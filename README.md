# dokku-api
REST service for interacting with the Dokku command line utility

This is intended to be used as the interface by which [dokku-dash](https://github.com/nikelmwann/dokku-dash) interacts with the Dokku instance running on the host machine.

##### Footnote

This is pretty much just a practice exercise for me. It's not intended to ever be a production ready solution to managing a Dokku apps.

Not exactly sure how this will work yet. Progress will probably be a bit slow since I don't have a ton of free time.

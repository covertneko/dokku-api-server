# dokku-api-server
REST service for managing a Dokku host.

This is intended to be used as the interface through which
[dokku-dash](https://github.com/nikelmwann/dokku-dash) interacts with the Dokku
instance running on the host machine, though it should work with anything - it
may just lack certain features or details.

This can be installed easily on any Dokku host via the
[dokku-api](https://github.com/nikelmwann/dokku-api) plugin.

##### Disclaimer

This is pretty much just a practice exercise for me. It's not intended to ever be a production ready solution to managing a Dokku host.

Progress will probably be a bit slow since I don't have a ton of free time.
